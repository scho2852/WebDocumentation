			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>Australia for UNHCR is a UN Refugee Agency’s national partner in Australia.</p>
			<h3>Organization Motto</h3>
			<blockquote>"Australians Empowering Refugees To Build A Better Future"</blockquote>
			<h3 id="key insights">Key Insights</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) aims to lead international actions towards worldwide protection of refugees and the resolution of refugee problems.</li>
				<li>About 80% of their total income comes from donations and bequests</li>
				<li>In 2019, over 90,000 Australians supported and raised $31.5 million</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="research">User Research</h3>
			<p> A brief assumption about user demographics of the organisation was done through an observation of their social media followings and an <a href="https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/#YT-demos" target="_blank"><strong>
      article</strong></a> about the platforms’ demographics was used to support the assumption of age groups. The order of the following size on each social media platform was from biggest to smallest: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. Facebook has two major audiences: one group from age 25-30 and 30-49, and another group 30-49 meanwhile the major audience for Twitter was 18-29. Instagram has a younger audience (13-17), and lastly Youtube audience spread among young to old people. (13-65+) From this, <strong>3 user groups</strong> were identified.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>18-29 age group (young)</li>
        <li>30-49 age group (mid)</li>
        <li>50-65 age group (old)</li>
      </ol><br>

      <h4>Secondary Research</h4>
			<p>	To further develop user profiles, key statistics and characteristics of each group was discovered from the <a href="https://good2give.ngo/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/CAF-Australia-Giving-Report-2019.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>2019 Australian Giving Report.</strong></a> The report provided insightful statistics that definitely guided me to build user profiles.The report also provided details of motivation, frustration, and behaviour of each groups.
      <h5>Key Insights from 2019 Australia Giving Report</h5>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>"The likelihood to give is fairly similar across the age groups, peaking slightly at three quarters (74%) of 25-34 year olds."</li>
          <li>"For older donors, caring about the cause (64% of those aged 55 years and over vs. 54% average) and trusting the organisations they donate to (43% vs. 32%) are more common reasons to give.”</li>
          <li>“Younger Australians are more likely to have volunteered in the last 12 months with nearly half (47%) of 18-24 year olds”</li> </p></blockquote><br>
      <p>Further research was done by reading of <a href="https://clarety-acf.s3.amazonaws.com/userimages/Resources/ACT_Report_McCrindle_Feb2019.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>The Australian Community Trends Report</strong></a> from 2017 and 2019. </p>
      <h5>Key Insights from 2017 Australian Community Trends Report</h5>
      <blockquote><ul>
        <li>"92% of Baby Boomers (age 53-71) have made financial donations, scoring higher than 70% of Gen Y (age 23-37) and 85% of Gen X population(age 38-52)"</li>
        <li>"The youngest Australians are the most likely to not give at all to charities or not-for-profit organisations, however they are the most likely to volunteer."</li>
        <li>"Children’s charities were the second most popular giving destination among Baby Boomers (age 55-73"</li>
        <li>"A well-established charity with a proven track record is more important to older Australian givers than their younger counterparts"</li>
        <li>"The older a charitable giver is, the more likely they are to give on a frequent or regular basis. On the inverse, the younger a charitable giver is the more likely they are to give to a charitable organisation when they hear about or see a need."</li></ul></blockquote>
        <p>In 2019, the same report identified that the top three qualities all age groups value in a charitable organisations are:</p>
        <ol><li>Transparent reporting of administration costs</li>
        <li>Well established with a proven track record</li>
        <li>Verification of registration as a charity</li>
        <li>Where donations are allocated</li>
        <li>Reporting of specific impacts</li></ol>
        <br>

        <p> While considering to include seniors as one of the user profiles, my major concern towards the age group was their level of technology skill. However, as research progressed, I was proven wrong. <a href="https://nationalseniors.com.au/news/media-release/new-research-reveals-seniors-are-more-tech-savvy" target="_blank"><strong>National Seniors Australia</strong></a>  reported that <strong>70%</strong> of those aged from 50-65 use an internet search engine everyday. <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/about-us/research/digital-behaviours-older-australians/digital-confidence" target="_blank"><strong>Australian Government’s eSafety Commissioner</strong></a> revealed that 77% of seniors from age 50 to 69 consider their digital literacy to be moderate to high. On the contrary, 74% of seniors aged 70 years and over answered to be digitally disengaged. Moreover, the majority of the moderate and high literaly groups owned a laptop or a desktop computer. (71% and 76% respectively). The findings helped me distinguish which age group among seniors to focus on for my design concept. </p><br>

        <h4>Primary Research</h4>
        <p> The secondary research was then followed by interviews. I interviewed 5 people from each of the two age groups: 20-22 and 58-67 to gain more insights. The first group were university students, and the later group was my relatives. Directly interacting with the targeted user groups gave me access to more realistic motivation, frustrations, and needs.</p>
        <h5>Key Quotes From the Interview</h5>
        <blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>“I give up immediately if I get lost on the website.” - 64yr old</li>
            <li>“I would trust the organization if I see a verified mark and a lot of photos and data.” - 21yr old</li>
            <li>“I don’t want to keep coming back to the donation page every time I want to give.” - 58yr old</li></ul>
        </blockquote>
      <h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
      <p>Based off of the research, I created two user profiles. The 2nd age group mentioned earlier (30-49 age) was eliminated due to the lack of information I obtained through secondary and primary researches.</p>

      <h3 id="target">Target Audience</h3>
      <p>As mentioned in Key Statistics,  <a href="https://www.acnc.gov.au/charity/673eb60bc05f99ed486534f82e11c39b" target="_blank">ACNC website</a> shows that the organization relies heavily on donations and benquets. After creating three user profiles and comparing which group most suits the organization’s needs, the Boomer Surfer is chosen to be the target audience. As discovered from the secondary research, the group’s characteristics of donating frequently and higher chance of them giving compared to other age groups perfectly match the organization’s main source of income. I also believe this decision will be a fun challenge for me to design a tech beginner friendly website for seniors.

      <h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
      <p>Although the research shows that Boomer Surfers are digitally iterate, I should still be mindful that they are <strong>definitely not as tech savvy as young people.</strong> With that in mind, I have come up with several key points for my web design concept.</p>
      <ul><li>Simple layout and navigation</li>
      <li>Easily viewed content (eg. big text, big buttons)</li>
      <li>Earn trust:<ul>
        <li>Provide verification of administration as a charity</li>
        <li>Where donations are going</li>    
        <li>Provide engaging statistics and data (eg. # of houses built for refugees)</li>
        <li>Present well tracked data</li></ul></li>
      <li>Earn empathy:<ul>
        <li>Desciprtion and media showing current crisis of refugees</li>
        <li>Media of organization staffs helping refugees</li></ul></li></ul>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>During the ideation process, I ensured myself to not limit my design thinking in one form of style, but show deep exploration and iteration of multiple concepts. Moreover, I kept in mind to show evidence of self-reflection and design decisions through documentation.</p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Moodboards are powerful tool to determine what direction I want the website to head to. I created two moodboards that each explore different design style.</p>
      <h4>Moodboard #1</h4>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/mood1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Moodboard #1 created on Adobe Spark</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The first moodboard explored my initial design concept, which was to provide credibility, earn empathy. The main idea of my first moodboard is to create a website that transmits seriousness and professionalism to the viewer. Simple font, contrast in font size and color demonstrate the simple yet convincing tone as I wish my website to have.</p>

       <h4>Moodboard #1</h4>
      <figure>
				<img src="images/mood2.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Moodboard #2 created on Adobe Spark</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The second moodboard focused more on the design elements that are senior friendly. The inspirations were taken from phone screens and websites that are specifically designed for elderly. The prominent characteristisc include big display of text and images and more detailed labelining of navigation elements.</p>
      <h4>Overall</h4>
      <p>Although the tone of each moodboard is completely different to each other, I believe that creating a well balanced mixture of the design elements from both moodboards will create a call-to-action website that strongly encourages seniors to donate. </p>

      <h3 id="sitemaps">Sitemaps</h3>
      <p>	The website must have a bone structure before adding meat(contents) to it.
      <h4>Step 1</h4> 
      <p>I first determined what content should be on the website to achieve my concept goals. I then made cards of content that should be presented to achieve that stage.The process helped me decide what information should be presented to users to complete a certain task/goal. Visually organizing information also helped me not get overwhelmed trying to do this process in my head.</p>
        <figure>
				<img src="images/ideation1.png"/>
        <figcaption>created on Miro</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Step 2</h4> 
      <p>I then organized the sticky notes into categories which could later be used for sitemap. Keeping the research findings in mind, the categories were created and laid out to serve the main purpose of the website: engage repeated donation through trust and sympathy.Separating the information (contents I have chosen to include on the website) into appropriate categories is a crucial step to build information architecture.</p>
        <figure>
				<img src="images/ideation2.png"/>
        <figcaption>created on Miro</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Step 3</h4> 
      <p>The previous diagram was translated into a sitemap. The categories were placed in appropriate order from left to right to create the ideal flow of user experience. The sketch is very simple with only the categories on it. Even so, some improvements were made. For example, “How can you help” was replaced with “Donate” so users do not have to make two clicks to access the donation page.</p>
        <figure>
				<img src="images/sitemap1.png"/>
        <figcaption>Sitemap #1 illustrated on Procreate</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Step 4</h4> 
      <p> A few improvements were made on the navigation categories. First, “Our work” was put under “Learn.” This is due to the fact that the organization’s actions vary by refugee groups / countries, so the presentation of the information is separated by the same way the content under “Learn” is separated. As a result, I believe it is more appropriate to present the information together. “Our Achievements” and “Your impact” were combined into one category: “Our Impact” The decision was made due to the similarity between the two categories. The organization takes actions with the donation they received from givers. I wanted to emphasize that the two groups work closely together to achieve the same goal. Moreover, “Contact Us” was added for a new user to efficiently get additional information with the individuals from the organization. The section adds transparency of the organization which leads to gaining more trust. As you see, each category went more in depth with details that were determined on step 2. </p>
        <figure>
				<img src="images/sitemap2.png"/>
        <figcaption>Sitemap #2 illustrated on Procreate</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Step 5</h4> 
      <p>The third and final  sitemap was created digitally for easier view. Another level was added under "What's Happening" for organizing the content better. This way, user can choose which speciifc refugee problem, THEN learn about it on next page. My sietmap may seem simple and plain, however it was designed to best fit the target audience's needs, which was obtaining information quickly without undergoing additional steps (clicks). </p>
        <figure>
				<img src="images/sitemap3.png"/>
        <figcaption>Sitemap #3 on Gloomaps</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>I moved on to focusing on the design elements of my website. Sketches were done based on the moodboards and the sitemap I created. Multiple sketches for each section was illustrated and iterated to freely allow myself to explore different styles of web design. From the research, I focusde on creating sketches of a laptop screen. After completing multiple sketches, a comparison was done on Miro. There, I noted down positive and negative points about each sketches, and made additional notes for improvements. Keep in mind that my sketches were usually combined (since each had both positive and negative points) to create wireframes later.</p><br>

      <h4>Home Page</h4>
      <p> My goal of the home page is to get user's attention and make sure they do not leave the website. I created three different designs with that focus. All the designs had a big image at the top of the screen to make the front page eye-catching. Different styles of header was also explored during this process.

      </figure>

      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #3</strong> was chosen.</p><br>

      <h4>About Us Page</h4>
      <p> During this process, I explored different ways of displaying. Sketch #2 explores the concept of static and dynamic. User will click on the static bar to immediately view each content without the need of scrolling. </p>

      </figure>
      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #2</strong> was chosen.</p><br>

       <h4>What's Happening? Page</h4>
      <p> I got an idea to use tiles to organize and display information from the first moodboard.(Shown on 1st and 2nd sketches) Arrows were added to display the content efficiently without additional scroll. Moreover, sketch #3 provides better navigation with the circles showing how much content (# of crises) there are to the users.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #2</strong> was chosen <strong>with the navigation from sketch #3 to be added. </strong></p><br>

       <h4>Crisis Page</h4>
      <p> This section is displayed after a user clicks on a specific crisis to see in What's Happening? page. I explored different ways to display images: sketch #1 using right & left clicks and sketch #2 displaying all images in tiles.</p>
      <figure>

      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #2</strong> was chosen.</p><br>
    
    <h4>Our Impact Page</h4>
      <p> This page should show engaging statistics and data about what the organization has achieved. Moreover, pictures with descriptionto gain empathy as well.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #3</strong> was chosen.</p><br>

    <h4>Donate Page</h4>
      <p> This section was separated into a step-by-step. I especially focused on sketches of Amount section. I explored different types of inputs: number and slidebar.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="sketches/donate_1.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Donate (first half) sketches</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Donate page sketches comparison</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #1</strong> was chosen for Choose section, and <strong>sketch #2</strong> was chosen for Amount section. As seen on the green sticky note, I decided to come up with a layout that is constant, which was chosen to be <strong> sketch #2 </strong> of Thank You section. The layout is later refined. The constant layout of this section can be seen later in the wireframes.</p><br>

      <h4>Keep In Touch Page</h4>
      <p> Two sketches were created for this section. This page only has a sign up form, so the sketches are very simple.</p>
      <figure>
				<img src="sketches/Keep.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Keep In Touch sketches</figcaption>

      </figure>
      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #1</strong> was chosen since it follows the same layout of Donate section.</p><br>

      <h4>Contact Us Page</h4>
      <p> Simialrly to Keep In Touch page, this section only requires a inquiry form. The sketches are much more simple compared to the ones for the previous sections.</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="sketches/Contact.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Contact Us sketches</figcaption>

      <p> After the comparison, <strong>sketch #1</strong> was chosen since similarly to the chosen sketch for Keep In Touch, it follows the same layout of Donate section.</p><br>

		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>Following the exploraton of my sketches and idea for improvements, wireframes were created with more details of overall structure, alongside my mockups to add visual aesthetic.</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, I created a hybrid of the base sketch I had chosen in the comparison process and practical design elements of other sketches and idea for improvements that were noted down on Miro. <br>
      While creating wireframes based off of the sketches, I realized that I should've been more specific. I drew out sections but was not specific with text and image placements. Moreover, I learned that making everything big and visible does not mean it will be easier for elderly users to obtain all the information: <strong>visual hierarchy</strong> is much needed.</p><br>
			<!-- Use the figure element for embedding images and iframes with annotations/captions -->
      <h4>Home Page</h4>
      <p>With the chosen sketch, the page displays a big image of a refugee and a short phrase with white background to touch viewer's heart. The organization's motto is then displayed to give user a quick idea of what the organization is about. As the user scroll, they will receive a short description about the organization with an image. The donate button is big to be the most noticable element of the page.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="wireframes/home.png"/>
        <figcaption>Home Page wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>About Us Page</h4>
      <p>As finalized, the user will click on the navigation, which then the screen scrolls down automatically to present the desired content. As the user gets to the bottom of the page, big donate butotn is presented. The user has an option to donate after they read about the organization. </p>

			<figure>
				<img src="wireframes/aboutus.png"/>
        <figcaption>About Us wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>What's Happening? Page</h4>
      <p>Here, image carousel is used to provide all the crises that the organization is supporting. The user also has an option to select which crisis to view from a bar which will show options once the user clicks on it.</p>

        <figcaption>Crisis wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Our Impact Page</h4>
      <p>Following the final decision, more improvements were made on the design of this page. I struggle to balance the length of key data and donation allocations. The later was taking a bigger (longer) section since multiple data must be presented to gain credibility. Because of this, I created a section where a user can scroll through to view the data while viewing the donation allocations. A scroll bar was provided to let users know that the Key Data section is scrollable. Moreover, they have access to see the organization's annual report, which will definitely contribute to earning trust of the users.</p>

        <figcaption>Our Impact wireframe</figcaption>
      </figure><br>

      <h4>Donate Page</h4>
      <p>As mentioned in the previous step, a final layout of this section was chosen with the inspiration of sketch #2 of Thank You page. The user will constantly see an image of refugees, which they will feel more motivated to complete the donation process and even more, donate a bigger amount! The progress bar provides easy overview of how much the user has completed. As the user completes step 1 and 2, what they input will be displayed on the left (above image) as a reminder and make sure users make no incorrect donation.</p>

      </figure><br>

      <h4>Keep In Touch Page</h4>
      <p> Following the same style as donation page, this page will also have a picture of a refugee while they complete the form. Instruction was added at the top of the form for more clear guidance.</p>

			<figure>
				<img src="wireframes/keep.png"/>
        <figcaption>Keep In Touch wireframe</figcaption>
