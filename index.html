			<h2>Content and Design Alterations</h2>
			<p> In this section, changes that were made from the mockups from previous <a href="proposal.html" target="	_blank"> proposal </a> to final prototypes are discussed in detail. Keep in mind that bits of each pages are shown, rather than the whole page, as those could be viewed <a href="https://a5-revised.serichoi.repl.co/index.html" target="	_blank"> here.</a>
			Only the parts that were altered are presented and discussed.</p>
		</section>

      <section id="nav">
			<h2>Header</h2>
      <p>Instead of placing the organisation’s logo above the navigation bar, both are now placed on the same line. While creating the original header, I came to a realisation that its height is occupying too much space on the introductory part of a page. It was distracting when users open a page, since I wanted the main focus to be on the introductory section. Moreover, the ACNC logo was moved to the header. This is to keep the look of the navigation page clean. Lastly, the background color is now white. By blending the header with the background of the website, the whole website does not look cramped.</p>

		<section id="index">
			<h2>Index Page</h2>
			<p>Th Call-To-Action section is placed <strong>at the end</strong> of the page rather than in the same row was other content. By separating the contents and the CTA section, it helps users focus on what really matters. The white space draws viewers attention to the CTA section, which leaves a strong impact and encourages them to click the donate button. The macrospace before CTA section is placed throughout the website for the same purpose.</p>

		<section id="about">
			<h2>About Us Page</h2>
      <p>“Achievements” is deleted since its content is same as Our Impact page. More importantly, the navigation bar is changed to buttons. The buttons are created by radio elements. By applying buttons, user gets access to desired content without refreshing the page. This is created by indicating which button is currently selected. The selected button is in blue, while others are in gray. The contrast in color easily lets users know which section is being presented to them. The radio buttons are also consistently used in other pages. </p>

    <section id="what">
			<h2>What's Happening? Page</h2>
      <p>Due to the page limit set for this assignment, two pages were combined into one. Similarly to About Us page, buttons were provided so users can quickly alternate between the topics and learn about each crisis. Due to the limitation in my knowledge and experience with Javascript, only one of the three topics's content is provided for the web prototype. </p>

    <section id="impact">
			<h2>Our Impact Page</h2>
      <p>Rather than presenting all the informations at once in different sections as seen in the mockup, buttons were created so users can choose which information to view. By doing so, they don’t feel overwhelmed with all the information. This change was made based on the feedback saying users may get confused which section is scrollable since there is a small page (Key Highlights) within the original page, as seen in the mockup.</p>

    <section id="donate">
			<h2>Donate Page</h2>
      <p>All the steps that were split by pages are combined into one form to achieve the set page limit. Moreover, I came to a realization that it is better to thoroughly utilise the big screen space and put all the input sections on one page,rather than making users click several times to complete the donation process. Another advantage is that as senior users complete the form, they can always check if they have made correct choices, since seniors may be forgetful sometimes. For example, they do not have to click Back to check how much they are donating. All the inputs they have made are available right infront of them.</p>

    <section id="footer">
			<h2>Contact Us Page and Keep In Touch Page</h2>
      <p>Both were eliminated from the navigation bar and were put in footer. The reason beihnd this is logical thinking. It is very common for websites to have these sections in the footer. Usually, questions are raised after users finish reading a page. Because of this, it is more logical to ave the mat the bottom of the page.<br> Moreover, the pages were combined into one because both sections’ required types of inputs are very similar. The only difference is that users can put inquiry for Contact Us. Because of this, the two sections are combined and users can complete the form accordingly to their specific needs.<br> Lastly, links to the organization's social media is provided by icons.</p>

    <section> <!--talking about overall -->
    <h2>Wohle Website</h2>

    <section id="color">
			<h2>Theme Colours</h2>
      <p>	The theme colours of the website were darkened from sky-blue and yellow to navy blue and orange. This change was made from a feedback saying that the colour scheme of the mockup lacks sense of professionalism and seriousness. Although the colours were changed, the contrast between a warm-tone colour and a cool-tone colour is still present. </p></section>

    <section id="feedback">
			<h2>Visual Feedback</h2>
      <p>Multiple methods are used to demonstrate visual feedback to the users.
      <h3>Radio Buttons</h3>
      <p>As mentioned multiple times, radio elements were used to created buttons. The buttons toggle which content to show and which to hide. Because the labels are coded to be clickable, users can easily click the big buttons. The color contrast easily indicates which button is currently selected. </p> 
      <figure>
				<img src="radios.gif"/>
        <figcaption>Radio Buttons Animation</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <h3>Donate Button</h3>
      <p>The darkder color at the bottom of the button acts as a shadow, and gives an impression that this object is a clickable. Once a user hovers over the button, it enlarges, which prompts them to click it. Not only that, the button moves down when a user clicks it. This animation clearly indicates that a user has pressed the button.</p> 
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Donate Button Animation</figcaption>
      </figure> 

      <h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
      <p>A clear indication of which page a user is currently on was achieved by highlighting the selected navigation option. Moreover, both the background and the text colors change when a user hovers over the options.</p>

		</section>

    <section id="consistency">
			<h2>Consistency</h2>
      <p>Througout the website, the introductory section of each page uses the same layout: picture on the left and title and description on the right. Moreover, appropriate pages provide buttons to for toggling show/hide content is provided througouht the website. Consistency in web design build trust and teach users repeatable patterns which help them navigate through my website much quicker. This is especially important since my target user is seniors who are not as tech savvy as younger generations.</p></section>

    <section id="end">
			<h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
      <p>I am confident that the design of my website demonstrates my initial design concept.</p></section>
